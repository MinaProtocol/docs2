# Berkeley Upgrade

The Berkeley upgrade is a major upgrade that requires all nodes in a network to upgrade to a newer version. It's not backward-compatible. 

A major upgrade occurs when there are major changes to the core protocol that require all nodes on the network to update to the latest software.

## How to prepare for the Berkeley upgrade

The Berkeley upgrade requires upgrading all nodes, including archive nodes. One of required steps is to migrate archive databases from the current Mainnet format to Berkeley. This migration requires actions and efforts from node operators and exchanges.

## What will happen with orignal devnet/mainnet data

After migration you will have two databases:

- Orginal Devnet/Mainnet database with small data adjustments (all pending blocks from last canoncial block till fork block will be converted to canoncial)
- New Berkeley database based on Devnet/Mainnet data but:
  - without Devnet/Mainnet orphaned blocks
  - without pending blocks which are not in canoncial chain
  - with all pending blocks on canoncial chain converted to canoncial block

There is no need to preserve orginal Devnet/Mainnet database after migration. However, if for some reason you would like to keep Mainnet orphaned or non-canonical pending blocks, it is recommended to download the maintenance package for Devnet/Mainnet database.
