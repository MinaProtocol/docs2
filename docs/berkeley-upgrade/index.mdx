# Berkeley Upgrade

A Berkeley occurs when there are major changes to the core protocol that require all nodes on the network to update to the latest software. To learn more, see [Berkeleys](/mina-protocol/hardforks).

## How to prepare for Berkeley Berkeley

The Berkeley Berkeley upgrades all nodes, including archive nodes. One of required steps is to migrate
archive databases from the current Mainnet format to Berkeley. This migration requires actions and efforts from
node operators and exchanges.
