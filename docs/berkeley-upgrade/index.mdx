# Berkeley Upgrade

The Berkeley upgrade is a major upgrade that requires all nodes in a network to upgrade to a newer version. It's not backward-compatible. 

A major upgrade occurs when there are major changes to the core protocol that require all nodes on the network to update to the latest software. To learn more about major upgrades, see [Hard Forks](/mina-protocol/hardforks).

## How to prepare for the Berkeley upgrade

The Berkeley upgrade requires upgrading all nodes, including archive nodes. One of required steps is to migrate archive databases from the current Mainnet format to Berkeley. This migration requires actions and efforts from node operators and exchanges.
