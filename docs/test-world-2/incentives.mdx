# Testworld Mission 2.0 Protocol Performance Testing
The Testworld Mission 2.0: Protocol Performance Testing program is here. The goal of this program is to stress test the protocol and network with Mina community members to have a high level of confidence for Mina’s upcoming mainnet upgrade that will enable easier zkApps on Mina Mainnet.

The Program gathers experienced node operators to provide the network backbone for the Testworld 2.0 testnet. Participants will perform various node operation testing tasks for different grants. Participants can perform multiple node operation tasks.
## Incentives for the Testworld 2.0 Program
We detail the incentives per category of participant. Please note that the incentives cover a period of 2 months of testing. Should the testing last longer, the incentives may be adapted to cover the operational costs (servers).


## Block Production
Grant: 
- 850 USDC and 1,000 MINA tokens per Node Operator. 

Payout schedule:

- 425 USDC after confirmation of active participation on the testnet based on an uptime snapshot to determine nodes are online, which will be made around Oct 24, 2023. Payments are expected to be completed within 1 week after the snapshot.
- 425 USDC after confirmation at the end of the testnet that the Protocol Performance Testing T&C have been met. 
- 1,000 MINA tokens will be unlocked one year after Block Production’s successful completion of the testnet.
- Participants must fulfill KYC/AML requirements and remain in good-standing status during the testing to receive payments noted herein.

## Load Testing
Grant
- 1,600 USDC and 4,000 MINA tokens per Node Operator.

Payout schedule:

- 800 USDC after confirmation of active participation on the testnet based on an uptime snapshot, to determine nodes are online, that will be made around Oct 24, 2023. Payments are expected to be completed within 1 week after the snapshot.
- 800 USDC after confirmation the at the end of the testnet that the Protocol Performance Testing T&C have been met.
- 4,000 MINA tokens will be unlocked one year after Load Testing’s successful  completion of the testnet.
- Participants must fulfill KYC/AML requirements and remain in good-standing status during the testing to receive payments noted herein.

## SNARK Work
Grant
1. 400 USDC for the single SNARK Work coordinator
2. 600 USDC and 200 MINA tokens per SNARK worker

:::note
There will be 50 SNARK workers in total, spread over 10 Node Operators who will additionally run 1 Snark Coordinator each. The number of snarkworkers per Node Operator will vary.
:::

Payout schedule:

- 300 USDC per SNARK worker run + 200 USDC for the SNARK Work coordinator after confirmation of fulfilling KYC/AML requirements. The intention is for the grant to be disbursed before the launch of the testnet.
- 300 USDC per SNARK worker run + 200 USDC for the SNARK Work coordinator is intended to be disbursed prior to the second month of the testnet.
- 200 MINA tokens per SNARK worker run will be unlocked one year after SNARK Work’s successful completion of the testnet.
- Participants must fulfill KYC/AML requirements and remain in good-standing status during the testing to receive payments noted herein.

## Archive Node. 
Grant
- 500 USDC and 1,000 MINA tokens per Node Operator.

Payout schedule:

- 250 USDC after confirmation of fulfilling KYC/AML requirements. The intention is for the grant to be disbursed before the launch of the testnet.
- 250 USDC after confirmation at the end of the testnet that the Protocol Performance Testing T&C have been met.
- 1,000 MINA tokens will be unlocked one year after Archive Node’s successful  completion of the testnet.
- Participants must fulfill KYC/AML requirements and remain in good-standing status during the testing to receive payments noted herein.
