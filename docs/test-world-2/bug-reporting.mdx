# Testworld Mission 2.0 Protocol Performance Testing
The Testworld Mission 2.0: Protocol Performance Testing program is here. The goal of this program is to stress test the protocol and network with Mina community members to have a high level of confidence for Minaâ€™s upcoming mainnet upgrade that will enable easier zkApps on Mina Mainnet.

The Program gathers experienced node operators to provide the network backbone for the Testworld 2.0 testnet. Participants will perform various node operation testing tasks for different grants. Participants can perform multiple node operation tasks.

## Reporting Bugs

Thank you for helping stress test the protocol and network for the upcoming Mainnet upgrade. Your active engagement, rigorous testing, and feedback are valuable and appreciated. 

You play an integral role in advancing the Mina Protocol. 

**All participants** are expected to raise any abnormal behavior during the protocol performance testing on the Mina Protocol [GitHub](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3ATestworld-2-0-protocol-performance-testing%2CTestworld-2-0-block-producer%2CTestworld-2-0-load-tester%2CTestworld-2-0-snark-worker%2CTestworld-2-0-archive-node+) repository. Follow this guidance for using the correct labels.

- **Block Producers** are expected to raise any abnormal behavior during the protocol performance testing on the Mina Protocol [GitHub](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3ATestworld-2-0-protocol-performance-testing%2CTestworld-2-0-block-producer%2CTestworld-2-0-load-tester%2CTestworld-2-0-snark-worker%2CTestworld-2-0-archive-node+) repository, using both of these labels:

    - **Testworld-2-0-protocol-performance-testing** 
    - **Testworld-2-0-block-producer**

- **Load Testers** are expected to raise any abnormal behavior during the protocol performance testing on the Mina Protocol [GitHub](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3ATestworld-2-0-protocol-performance-testing%2CTestworld-2-0-block-producer%2CTestworld-2-0-load-tester%2CTestworld-2-0-snark-worker%2CTestworld-2-0-archive-node+) repository, using both of these labels:
