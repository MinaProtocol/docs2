# Testworld Mission 2.0 Protocol Performance Testing
The Testworld Mission 2.0: Protocol Performance Testing program is here. The goal of this program is to stress test the protocol and network with Mina community members to have a high level of confidence for Minaâ€™s upcoming mainnet upgrade that will enable easier zkApps on Mina Mainnet.

The Program gathers experienced node operators to provide the network backbone for the Testworld 2.0 testnet. Participants will perform various node operation testing tasks for different grants. Participants can perform multiple node operation tasks.

## Test Plan

Your role as node operators is paramount in ensuring the success of Testworld 2.0. Below are the instructions and test plan details for your reference.

- Network Structure: The Testworld 2.0 network ledger mirrors the mainnet structure with approximately 200k accounts.
- Participants: We have 250 community members managing various aspects of the network.


### Epoch 1 : Ensuring smooth onboarding

#### Goals:
- Verify tooling functionality.
- Resolve node setup and connection issues.
- Conduct small experiments for validation.| 

#### Runbook:

Day 1:
- Block Producers operators run 2 node replicas each with the same staking key to connect their nodes.
- 10 SNARK work operators set up SNARK infrastructure with a total of 10 SNARK coordinators, 50 SNARK Worker servers and 200 SNARK worker processes (4 SNARK worker processes per server) with the following breakdown:
  - 2 operators will run 1 SNARK coordinator and 10 SNARK worker servers
  - 1 operator will run 1 SNARK coordinator and 7 SNARK worker servers
  - 3 operators will run 1 SNARK coordinator and 5 SNARK worker servers
  - 4 operators will run 1 SNARK coordinator and 2 SNARK worker servers

Day 5:
- Verify all nodes are connected.

Day 10:
- Run the transaction generator at half the goal throughput for 24 hours.

### Epoch 2: Testing higher loads and scalability

#### Goals:
- Test higher transaction loads.
- Increase the number of nodes.
- Test zkApps contracts from Mina builders.

#### Runbook:

Day 7:
- zkApp builders deploy their contracts for testing.

Day 8:
- Load-testing BPs spin up an additional 200 non-consensus nodes (10 nodes each).

Day 10:
- Run transaction generator at goal throughput for 24 hours with increased node count.

Day 12:
- Load-testing BPs spin down extra nodes.


### Epoch 3: Testing higher loads and scalability with extra epoch complexity

#### Goals:
- Test higher transaction loads with increased nodes.
- Test load increase from being in the 3rd epoch.

#### Runbook:

Day 8:
- Load-testing BPs increase the number of nodes on the network.

Day 10:
- Run transaction generator at goal throughput for 24 hours with increased node count.

Day 12:
- Load-testing BPs spin down extra nodes.
