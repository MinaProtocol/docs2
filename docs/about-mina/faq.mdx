Frequently Asked Questions about Mina Protocol
</Subhead>

### What language is Mina written in?

The Mina node is written in OCaml. But you don't need to know OCaml to write smart contracts for Mina.

### What language are zkApp smart contracts written in?

Mina's zero knowledge smart contracts ("zkApps") are written in TypeScript.

Learn more about [how to write a zkApp](/zkapps/how-to-write-a-zkapp).

### How large is the Mina Blockchain?

22KB

### Given Mina is only 22KB, where are past transactions stored?

The Mina node can run with an optional flag to make it an archive node. This means it stores historic transactions, which is useful for anyone running a service such as a block explorer. Still, this data is not needed in order to verify the current consensus state of the protocol.

### What ZK proof system does Mina use?

Mina Protocol uses a custom proof system called Kimchi, which was developed by [O(1) Labs](https://o1labs.org/), and is the only blockchain offering infinite recursion.

Check out the [Mina Book](https://o1-labs.github.io/proof-systems/plonk/overview.html) to learn more about Kimchi and the cryptography powering Mina Protocol.
