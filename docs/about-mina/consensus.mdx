# Consensus

Mina Protocol uses a proof of stake (PoS) consensus mechanism called _Ouroboros Samasika_. 

Consensus is the process by which the network determines which information is retained in the blockchain. To learn more, see the [Proof-of-Work vs Proof-of-Stake](https://minaprotocol.com/blog/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) blog post.

How Ouroboros Samasika works is explained in this video:

## Decentralization properties

Based on Cardano's PoS Ouroboros, Ouroboros Samisika is a secure PoS protocol with strong decentralization properties: 

- Can resolve long-range forks without relying on third parties to provide history
- **No staking minimum** — You can produce blocks and receive block rewards based on your percentage of MINA staked on the network. Any user with any amount of MINA can receive these rewards.
- **No slashing** — Mina protocol does not need explicit slashing, since the protocol already enforces the required level of correctness.
