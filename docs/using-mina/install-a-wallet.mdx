# Install a Wallet

<Subhead>
Learn about wallets you can use to send and receive MINA
</Subhead>

  The Mina community has created a variety of different wallets. You can send
  and receive MINA using any of these wallets, but currently only Auro Wallet
  for Chrome supports interactions with zkApps.

- [Auro Wallet (Chrome, Firefox, iOS, & Android)](https://www.aurowallet.com)
- [Clorio Wallet (Windows, MacOS, Linux, & online)](https://clor.io)
- [Staking Power (iOS & Android)](https://www.staking-power.com)
- [Ledger Hardware Wallet](https://www.ledger.com/mina-wallet) (see instructions [here](../using-mina/ledger-hardware-wallet))

:::note

The Mina network charges a one-time account creation fee of 1 MINA for spam prevention. It will be automatically deducted from the first transaction received.

### Wallet for Node Operators

The Mina CLI also provides the ability to store, send, & receive MINA. However, this intended only for Mina node operators and we do **not** recommend this as a wallet for typical users. View the [Mina CLI docs](/node-operators/cli-reference) to learn more.
