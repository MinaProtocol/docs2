title: How to delegate (stake)
---

Staking MINA tokens allows nodes on the network to increase their chances of being selected as a block producer in accordance with the consensus mechanism. The chance of winning the block scales in proportion to the amount of MINA staked. For example, if one node stakes 50% of the available MINA in the network, they theoretically have a 50% chance of being selected to produce future blocks. Mina uses Ouroboros Samisika Proof-of-Stake to implement the details of staking. If a node chooses to stake its MINA tokens, it is required to be online and connected to the Mina network.

Because staking MINA tokens requires nodes to be online, some nodes may desire to delegate their mina to another node that runs a staking service. This process is called delegating a stake, and often the service provider or staking pool operator may charge a fee for running this service. 

Currently, hundreds of block producers are accepting delegations on Mina. You can find them on this dashboard* that the community built. Currently, the protocol is designed in such a way that staking pool operators receive all block rewards and they need to send you the rewards after deducting any fees. Be sure to do your own due diligence before selecting a staking pool. If you have any questions about the staking pools, you can join our Discord server and ask in the #staking-pools channel.
