The maximum number of zkApp transactions per block is currently capped at 24. This restriction will gradually be lifted following the mainnet upgrade.

### What are zkApps?

zkApps (zero knowledge apps) are Mina Protocol smart contracts powered by zero knowledge proofs, specifically using zk-SNARKs.

zkApps use an **off-chain execution** and mostly **off-chain state** model. This allows for private computation and state that can be either private or public.

zkApps can perform arbitrarily-complex computations off chain while incurring only a flat fee to send the resulting zero-knowledge proof to the chain for verification of this computation, as opposed to other blockchains that run computations on chain and use a variable gas-fee based model.

### TypeScript

zkApps are written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

TypeScript provides an easy, familiar language (JavaScript), but with type safety, making it easy to get started writing zkApps. If you're new to using TypeScript, check out this helpful 12-min introductory video [TypeScript - The Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahCwqrYpIuM).

To learn more, see [How to Write a zkApp](/zkapps/how-to-write-a-zkapp).

### Examples of zkApps

Play around with a few example zkApps to see what's possible:

    zkApps are a great fit for applications that require proof that you have a
    secret without revealing it to anyone.
