zkApp programmability is not yet available on the Mina Mainnet. You can get started now by deploying zkApps to the Berkeley Testnet.

### What are zkApps?

zkApps (zero knowledge apps) are Mina Protocol smart contracts powered by zero knowledge proofs, specifically using zk-SNARKs.

zkApps use an **off-chain execution** and mostly **off-chain state** model. This allows for private computation and state that can be either private or public.

zkApps can perform arbitrarily-complex computations off chain while incurring only a flat fee to send the resulting zero-knowledge proof to the chain for verification of this computation, as opposed to other blockchains that run computations on chain and use a variable gas-fee based model.

### TypeScript

zkApps are written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

TypeScript provides an easy, familiar language (JavaScript), but with type safety, making it easy to get started writing zkApps. If you're new to using TypeScript, check out this helpful 12-min introductory video [TypeScript - The Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahCwqrYpIuM).

To learn more, see [How to Write a zkApp](/zkapps/how-to-write-a-zkapp).

### Quickstart

To get started, deploy a zkApp in 5 steps:

1. `npm install -g zkapp-cli` to install the zkApp CLI and make the `zk` command available on your system
2. `zk project <name>`
3. `cd <name>`
4. `zk config`

  Follow the command prompts to your configure your project's `config.json` file. 
  
  - name: `berkeley` (name can be anything)
  - Mina GraphQL API URL: `https://proxy.berkeley.minaexplorer.com/graphql`
  - transaction fee: `0.1`
 
  Follow the prompts to request Testnet MINA (tMINA) to fund your fee payer account. Click the URL in your terminal to request tMINA on your address. Wait ~3 minutes for the next block so you have enough tMINA to send your deploy transaction.

5. `zk deploy berkeley`

  The project you just created contains an example smart contract named `Add.ts` that stores a number as on-chain state and adds `2` to it whenever a transaction is received by the zkApp account.

You just deployed a zkApp!

### Examples of zkApps

Play around with a few example zkApps to see what's possible:

    zkApps are a great fit for applications that require proof that you have a
    secret without revealing it to anyone.
