```ts
type Transaction: object;
```

Defines the structure and operations associated with a transaction.
This type encompasses methods for serializing the transaction, signing it, generating proofs,
and submitting it to the network.

## Type declaration

### transaction

```ts
transaction: ZkappCommand;
```

Transaction structure used to describe a state transition on the Mina blockchain.

### prove()

Initiates the proof generation process for the [Transaction](Transaction.mdx). This asynchronous operation is
crucial for zero-knowledge-based transactions, where proofs are required to validate state transitions.
This can take some time.

#### Returns

`Promise`\<(`undefined` \| [`Proof`](../../../classes/Proof.mdx)\<[`ZkappPublicInput`](../../../type-aliases/ZkappPublicInput.mdx), `undefined`\>)[]\>

#### Example

```ts
await transaction.prove();
```

### safeSend()

Sends the [Transaction](Transaction.mdx) to the network. Unlike the standard Transaction.send, this function does not throw an error if internal errors are detected. Instead, it returns a [PendingTransaction](PendingTransaction.mdx) if the transaction is successfully sent for processing or a [RejectedTransaction](RejectedTransaction.mdx) if it encounters errors during processing or is outright rejected by the Mina daemon.

#### Returns

`Promise`\<[`PendingTransaction`](PendingTransaction.mdx) \| [`RejectedTransaction`](RejectedTransaction.mdx)\>

A promise that resolves to a [PendingTransaction](PendingTransaction.mdx) if the transaction is accepted for processing, or a [RejectedTransaction](RejectedTransaction.mdx) if the transaction fails or is rejected.

#### Example

```ts
const result = await transaction.safeSend();
if (result.status === 'pending') {
  console.log('Transaction sent successfully to the Mina daemon.');
} else if (result.status === 'rejected') {
  console.error('Transaction failed with errors:', result.errors);
}
```

### send()

Submits the [Transaction](Transaction.mdx) to the network. This method asynchronously sends the transaction
for processing. If successful, it returns a [PendingTransaction](PendingTransaction.mdx) instance, which can be used to monitor the transaction's progress.
If the transaction submission fails, this method throws an error that should be caught and handled appropriately.

#### Returns

`Promise`\<[`PendingTransaction`](PendingTransaction.mdx)\>

A promise that resolves to a [PendingTransaction](PendingTransaction.mdx) instance representing the submitted transaction if the submission is successful.

#### Throws

An error if the transaction cannot be sent or processed by the network, containing details about the failure.

#### Example

```ts
try {
  const pendingTransaction = await transaction.send();
  console.log('Transaction sent successfully to the Mina daemon.');
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to send transaction to the Mina daemon:', error);
}
```

### sign()

Signs all [AccountUpdate](../../../classes/AccountUpdate.mdx)s included in the [Transaction](Transaction.mdx) that require a signature.
[AccountUpdate](../../../classes/AccountUpdate.mdx)s that require a signature can be specified with `{AccountUpdate|SmartContract}.requireSignature()`.

#### Parameters

â€¢ **privateKeys**: [`PrivateKey`](../../../classes/PrivateKey.mdx)[]

The list of keys that should be used to sign the [Transaction](Transaction.mdx)

#### Returns

[`Transaction`](Transaction.mdx)

The [Transaction](Transaction.mdx) instance with all required signatures applied.

#### Example

```ts
const signedTx = transaction.sign([userPrivateKey]);
console.log('Transaction signed successfully.');
```

### toGraphqlQuery()

Constructs the GraphQL query string used for submitting the transaction to a Mina daemon.

#### Returns

`string`

The GraphQL query string for the [Transaction](Transaction.mdx).

### toJSON()

Serializes the transaction to a JSON string.

#### Returns

`string`

A string representation of the [Transaction](Transaction.mdx).

### toPretty()

Produces a pretty-printed JSON representation of the [Transaction](Transaction.mdx).

#### Returns

`any`

A formatted string representing the transaction in JSON.
