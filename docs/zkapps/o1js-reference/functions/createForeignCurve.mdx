```ts
createForeignCurve(params): typeof ForeignCurve
```

Create a class representing an elliptic curve group, which is different from the native [Group](../type-aliases/Group.mdx).

```ts
const Curve = createForeignCurve(Crypto.CurveParams.Secp256k1);
```

`createForeignCurve(params)` takes curve parameters CurveParams as input.
We support `modulus` and `order` to be prime numbers up to 259 bits.

The returned [ForeignCurve](../classes/ForeignCurve.mdx) class represents a _non-zero curve point_ and supports standard
elliptic curve operations like point addition and scalar multiplication.

[ForeignCurve](../classes/ForeignCurve.mdx) also includes to associated foreign fields: `ForeignCurve.Field` and `ForeignCurve.Scalar`, see [createForeignField](createForeignField.mdx).

## Parameters

â€¢ **params**: `CurveParams`

## Returns

*typeof* [`ForeignCurve`](../classes/ForeignCurve.mdx)
