```ts
Struct<A, T, J, Pure>(type): (value) => T & object & Pure extends true ? ProvablePure<T> : Provable<T> & object
```

`Struct` lets you declare composite types for use in o1js circuits.

These composite types can be passed in as arguments to smart contract methods, used for on-chain state variables
or as event / action types.

Here's an example of creating a "Voter" struct, which holds a public key and a collection of votes on 3 different proposals:
```ts
let Vote = { hasVoted: Bool, inFavor: Bool };

class Voter extends Struct({
  publicKey: PublicKey,
  votes: [Vote, Vote, Vote]
}) {}

// use Voter as SmartContract input:
class VoterContract extends SmartContract {
  \@method register(voter: Voter) {
    // ...
  }
}
```
In this example, there are no instance methods on the class. This makes `Voter` type-compatible with an anonymous object of the form
`{ publicKey: PublicKey, votes: Vote[] }`.
This mean you don't have to create instances by using `new Voter(...)`, you can operate with plain objects:
```ts
voterContract.register({ publicKey, votes });
```

On the other hand, you can also add your own methods:
```ts
class Voter extends Struct({
  publicKey: PublicKey,
  votes: [Vote, Vote, Vote]
}) {
  vote(index: number, inFavor: Bool) {
    let vote = this.votes[i];
    vote.hasVoted = Bool(true);
    vote.inFavor = inFavor;
  }
}
```

In this case, you'll need the constructor to create instances of `Voter`. It always takes as input the plain object:
```ts
let emptyVote = { hasVoted: Bool(false), inFavor: Bool(false) };
let voter = new Voter({ publicKey, votes: Array(3).fill(emptyVote) });
voter.vote(1, Bool(true));
```

In addition to creating types composed of Field elements, you can also include auxiliary data which does not become part of the proof.
This, for example, allows you to re-use the same type outside o1js methods, where you might want to store additional metadata.

To declare non-proof values of type `string`, `number`, etc, you can use the built-in objects `String`, `Number`, etc.
Here's how we could add the voter's name (a string) as auxiliary data:
```ts
class Voter extends Struct({
  publicKey: PublicKey,
  votes: [Vote, Vote, Vote],
  fullName: String
}) {}
```

Again, it's important to note that this doesn't enable you to prove anything about the `fullName` string.
From the circuit point of view, it simply doesn't exist!
