```ts
type Provable<T>: Provable_<T>;
```

`Provable<T>` is the general interface for provable types in o1js.

`Provable<T>` describes how a type `T` is made up of [Field](Field.mdx) elements and "auxiliary" (non-provable) data.

`Provable<T>` is the required input type in several methods in o1js.
One convenient way to create a `Provable<T>` is using `Struct`.

All built-in provable types in o1js ([Field](Field.mdx), [Bool](Bool.mdx), etc.) are instances of `Provable<T>` as well.

Note: These methods are meant to be used by the library internally and are not directly when writing provable code.
