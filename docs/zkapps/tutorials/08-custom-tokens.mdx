# Tutorial 8: Custom Tokens

In this tutorial, you learn to create custom tokens.

Mina comes with native support for custom tokens. Each account on Mina can also have tokens associated with it.

To create a new token, one creates a smart contract, which becomes the manager for the token, and uses that contract to set the rules around how the token can be mint, burned, and sent.

The manager account may also set a token symbol for its token, such as in this example, `MYTKN`. Uniqueness is not enforced for token names. Instead the public key of the manager account is used to identify tokens.

In this tutorial, you review smart contract code that creates and manages new tokens. 

The full example code is provided in the [08-custom-tokens/src/](https://github.com/o1-labs/docs2/tree/main/examples/zkapps/08-custom-tokens/src) example files.

For reference, a more extensive example, including all the ways to interact with token smart contracts, is provided in [token.test.ts](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/blob/main/src/lib/token.test.ts).

## Prerequisites

- Ensure your environment meets the [Prerequisites](/zkapps/tutorials#prerequisites) for zkApp Developer Tutorials.

This tutorial has been tested with:

- [Mina zkApp CLI](https://github.com/o1-labs/zkapp-cli) version 0.17.2
- [o1js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/o1js) version 0.17.0

## Create the project

1. Create or change to a directory where you have write privileges.
1. Create a project by using the `zk project` command:

  ```sh
  $ zk project 08-custom-tokens
  ```

  The `zk project` command has the ability to scaffold the UI for your project. For this tutorial, select `none`:

  ```
  ? Create an accompanying UI project too? …
    next
    svelte
    nuxt
    empty
  ❯ none
  ```
## Prepare the project

1. Change to the project directory, delete the existing files, and create a new `src/BasicTokenContract` smart contract, and a `index.ts` file:

  ```sh
  $ cd 08-custom-tokens
  $ rm src/Add.ts
  $ rm src/Add.test.ts
  $ rm src/interact.ts
  $ zk file src/BasicTokenContract
  $ touch src/index.ts
  ```

1. Edit `index.ts` to import and export your new smart contract:

  ```ts
  import { BasicTokenContract } from './BasicTokenContract.js';

  export { BasicTokenContract };
  ```

1. Add the official token standard implementation to your project dependencies

  ```sh
  $ npm i mina-fungible-token
  ```

## Concepts

As mentioned above, Mina comes with custom token mechanism built-in.

Let's pause to explore terms and ideas, that are essential for understanding how this mechanism is implemented in Mina.

### Token Manager

The token manager account is a zkApp that can:

- Set a token symbol (also called token name) for its token. Uniqueness is not enforced for token names because the public key of the manager account is used to derive a unique identifier for each token.
- Mint new tokens. The zkApp updates an account's balance by adding the newly created tokens to it. You can send minted tokens to any existing account in the network.
- Burn tokens (the opposite of minting). Burning tokens deducts the balance of a certain address by the specified amount. A zkApp cannot burn more tokens than the specified account has.
- Send tokens between two accounts. This must be approved by a zkApp (see [Approval mechanism](#approval-mechanism)).

### Token Account

Token accounts are like regular accounts, but they hold a balance of a specific custom token instead of MINA. A token account is created from an existing account and is specified by a public key _and_ a token id. 

Token accounts are specific for each type of custom token, so a single public key can have many different token accounts.

A token account is automatically created for a public key whenever an existing account receives a transaction denoted with a custom token. 

:::note

When a token account is created for the first time, an account creation fee must be paid the same as creating a new standard account.

:::

### Token ID

Token ids are unique identifiers that distinguish between different types of custom tokens. Custom token identifiers are globally unique across the entire network.

Token ids are derived from a zkApp. To check the token id of a zkApp, use the `this.deriveTokenId()` function.

### Approval mechanism

Sending tokens between two accounts must be approved by a Token Manager zkApp. This can be done with `approveBase()` method of the custom token standard reference implementation. 

If you customize the `transfer()` function, don't forget to call `approveBase()`.

### Upgradeability

As opposet to most blockchains, where you deploy a bytecode, on Mina, when you deploy a smart contract you generate a verification key from the contract source code. The verification key is stored on-chain and used to verify proofs that belong to that smart contract.

That means, that upgradeability is achieved by changing the verification key. In the Customn Token Standard implementation this can be done with `setVerificationKey()` method.

## FungibleTokenBase implementation overview

The token standard implementation is a Token Manager zkApp that is splitted in 2 parts: low-level and high-level logic.

The low-level implementation is included in `o1js` library `TokenContract` abstract class. See the overview in the o1js [Custom Tokens tutorial](../o1js/custom-tokens)

The high-level part inherts from the `TokenContract` class and has following user-facing features:

### On-chain State, `decimals` and deploy arguments

The on-chain state is defined as follows:

```ts
@state(PublicKey) public adminAccount = State<PublicKey>();
@state(UInt64) public totalSupply = State<UInt64>();
@state(UInt64) public circulatingSupply = State<UInt64>();
```

- The `adminAccount` is set on deployment, and some of token functionality requires an admin signature.

    If you want to implement admin-only method, just call `this.requireAdminSignature()` helper in the method you want to protect.

- The `totalSupply` defines a maximum amount of tokens to exist. It is set on deployment and can be modified with `setTotalSupply()` function (can be called by admin only)

- The `circulatingSupply` tracks the total amount in circulation. When new tokens are minted, the `circulatingSupply` changes by an amount minted.

- The `decimals` is a constant, that defines where to place the decimal comma in the token amounts. It is exposed in `getDecimals()` method.

- The `.deploy()` function requires `adminAccount` and `totalSupply` to be passed as parameters.

### Methods

Transfer and burn functionality is available by following methods:

```ts
transfer(from: PublicKey | AccountUpdate, to: PublicKey | AccountUpdate, amount: UInt64 | number | bigint)
burn(from: PublicKey, amount: UInt64)
```

Methods that can be called only by admin are:

```ts
mint(address: PublicKey, amount: UInt64)
setVerificationKey(verificationKey: VerificationKey)
setTotalSupply(amount: UInt64)
```

Helper methods for reading state and fetching account balance

```ts
getBalanceOf(address: PublicKey)
getTotalSupply()
getCirculatingSupply()
getDecimals()
```

That completes a review of a basic token. 

## Create and deploy a custom token

To create a token manager smart contract, inherit your smart contract from base custom token implementation

```ts
import {
  FungibleToken
} from 'mina-fungible-token';

class MyToken extends FungibleToken {}
```

A full copy of the [MyToken.ts](https://github.com/o1-labs/docs2/blob/main/examples/zkapps/08-custom-tokens/src/BasicTokenContract.ts) is provided.


## Token Operations

### Mint tokens

### Burn tokens

### Transfer tokens between user accounts

### Build zkApp that interact with tokens

#### Implement a smart contract that use tokens

With zkApps, you can also build smart contracts that interact with tokens. For example, a simple escrow contract, where tokens can be deposited to and withdrawn from.

#### Transfer from user to smart contract

#### Transfer from contract to user

#### Transfer from contract to contract

### Implement custom mechanics

Overriding default burn functionality



To see an example of interacting with this contract, see [main.ts](https://github.com/o1-labs/docs2/blob/main/examples/zkapps/08-custom-tokens/src/main.ts).

To see an example of putting rules around a token, see this [example](https://github.com/o1-labs/docs2/blob/main/examples/zkapps/08-custom-tokens/src/WhitelistedTokenContract.ts) of a token with whitelist gating so that public keys can interact with it.


## Conclusion

You have finished reviewing the steps to build a smart contract to manage a token. You learned how to build a smart contract that places custom rules over tokens.
