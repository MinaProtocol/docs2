# Tutorial 5: Common Types and Functions

Welcome to tutorial 5. In previous tutorials, we've seen how to deploy smart contracts to the network, and we've interacted with them from both a React UI, nodejs, and the CLI.

In this tutorial, we will talk about more types that are useful when building with SnarkyJS, so you can build more applications. So far, we've mostly been using the `Field` type. While in theory you could do everything with just Fields, SnarkyJS provides many more useful types to help with development.

You can find all of these on the [SnarkyJS Reference page](../snarkyjs-reference), for their full API documentation.

There is also a project [here](https://github.com/es92/zkApp-examples/tree/main/05-common-types-and-functions/src), with a [main.ts](https://github.com/es92/zkApp-examples/blob/main/05-common-types-and-functions/src/main.ts) demoing the concepts presented in this tutorial, along with smart contracts showing more advanced usage of some of the concepts, particularly Merkle Trees.

## Basic Types

To start, we'll discuss 5 basic types derived from the Fields:

* [Bool](../snarkyjs-reference/classes/Bool)
* [UInt32](../snarkyjs-reference/classes/UInt32)
* [UInt64](../snarkyjs-reference/classes/UInt64)
* [Int64](../snarkyjs-reference/classes/Int64)
* [Character](../snarkyjs-reference/classes/Character)

These each have their usual programming language semantics.

For example, we can have the following code:

```ts
const num1 = UInt32.from(40);
const num2 = UInt64.from(40);

const num1EqualsNum2: Bool = num1.toUInt64().equals(num2);

console.log(`num1 == num2: ${num1EqualsNum2.toString()}`);
console.log(`Fields in num1: ${num1.toFields().length}`);

// --------------------------------------

const signedNum1 = Int64.from(-3);
const signedNum2 = Int64.from(45);

const signedNumSum = signedNum1.add(signedNum2);

console.log(`signedNum1 + signedNum2: ${signedNumSum.toString()}`);
console.log(`Fields in signedNum1: ${signedNum1.toFields().length}`);

// --------------------------------------

const char1 = Character.fromString('c');
const char2 = Character.fromString('d');

console.log(`char1: ${char1.toString()}`);
console.log(`char1 == char2:: ${char1.equals(char2).toString()}`);
console.log(`Fields in char1: ${char1.toFields().length}`);
```

And when run it'll print to the console:

```
num1 == num2: true
Fields in num1: 1
signedNum1 + signedNum2: 42
Fields in signedNum1: 2
char1: c
char1 == char2: false
Fields in char1: 1
```


## More Advanced Types

4 more advanced types are:

* [CircuitString](../snarkyjs-reference/classes/CircuitString)
* [Private keys](../snarkyjs-reference/classes/PrivateKey)
* [Public keys](../snarkyjs-reference/classes/Types.PublicKey)
* [Signatures](../snarkyjs-reference/classes/Signature)

One special thing to note, is that the default `CircuitString` has a max length of 128 characters. We'll see in the following section how to create custom types, where you could for example build your own strings, modifed to whatever length you would like.

A brief example of using these:

```ts
const str1 = CircuitString.fromString('abc..xyz');
console.log(`str1: ${str1.toString()}`);
console.log(`Fields in str1: ${str1.toFields().length}`);

// --------------------------------------

const privateKey = PrivateKey.random();
const publicKey = privateKey.toPublicKey();

const data1 = char2.toFields().concat(signedNumSum.toFields())
const data2 = char1.toFields().concat(str1.toFields());

const signature = Signature.create(privateKey, data2);

const verifiedData1 = signature.verify(publicKey, data1);
const verifiedData2 = signature.verify(publicKey, data2);

console.log(`private key: ${privateKey.toBase58()}`);
console.log(`public key: ${publicKey.toBase58()}`);
console.log(`Fields in private key: ${privateKey.toFields().length}`);
console.log(`Fields in public key: ${publicKey.toFields().length}`);

console.log(`signature verified for data1: ${verifiedData1.toString()}`);
console.log(`signature verified for data2: ${verifiedData2.toString()}`);

console.log(`Fields in signature: ${signature.toFields().length}`);
```

And the console output:

```
str1: abc..xyz
Fields in str1: 128
private key: EKF7vyCyexH6KZpBo4jPG29Ac7tcuYwS1MFwUudhZ6D8v3Ap88SY
public key: B62qo32qFbpLybPGtFDW8GT5Efu4ZtbUXDoj5vyTrmSp6AXgMh7btAH
Fields in private key: 255
Fields in public key: 2
signature verified for data1: false
signature verified for data2: true
Fields in signature: 256
```

## CircuitValue

:::info
`CircuitValue` is soon to be replaced with `Struct` in an upcoming version of SnarkyJS. Expect this tutorial to update to use `Struct` in the future accordingly.
:::

A special type is [CircuitValue](../snarkyjs-reference/classes/CircuitValue), which lets you create your own types for your application.

All arguments passed into smart contracts need to be arguments SnarkyJS can understand. Creating a CircuitValue allows you pass in structured pieces of data, which via their class definition can come with methods to manipulate them. 

See the following for an example of how to use `CircuitValue`, implementing a `Point` structure, and an array of points of length 8 structure.

SnarkyJS compiles programs into fixed sized circuits. This means that data structures it consumes must also be a fixed size, and is why we declare the array in `Points8` structure to be a static size of 8 in the example below.

```ts
class Point extends CircuitValue {
  @prop x: Field;
  @prop y: Field;

  static fromField(x: Field, y: Field) {
    return new Point(x, y);
  }

  static addPoints(a: Point, b: Point) {
    return new Point(a.x.add(b.x), a.y.add(b.y));
  }
}

const point1 = Point.fromField(Field(10), Field(4));
const point2 = Point.fromField(Field(1), Field(2));

const pointSum = Point.addPoints(point1, point2);

console.log(`pointSum Fields: ${pointSum.toFields().map((p) => p.toString())}`);

class Points8 extends CircuitValue {
  @arrayProp(Point, 8) points: Point[];

  constructor(points: Point[]) {
    super();
    this.points = points;
  }
}

const pointsArray = new Array(8).fill(null).map((_, i) => Point.fromField(Field(i), Field(i*10)));
const points8 = new Points8(pointsArray);

console.log(`points8 Fields: ${JSON.stringify(points8)}`);
```

Which prints the following to the console:

```
pointSum Fields: 11,6
points8 Fields: {"points":[{"x":"0","y":"0"},{"x":"1","y":"10"},{"x":"2","y":"20"},{"x":"3","y":"30"},{"x":"4","y":"40"},{"x":"5","y":"50"},{"x":"6","y":"60"},{"x":"7","y":"70"}]}
```

A great example of a complex use of CircuitValue is the MerkleTree implementation  - see the source for that [here](https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/blob/main/src/lib/merkle_tree.ts) for more.

## Control flow

There are two functions which help do control flow within SnarkyJS:

* [Circuit.if](../snarkyjs-reference/classes/Circuit#if)
* [Circuit.switch](../snarkyjs-reference/classes/Circuit#switch)

With these, you can write conditionals inside SnarkyJS.

For example:

```ts
const input1 = Int64.from(10);
const input2 = Int64.from(-15);

const inputSum = input1.add(input2);

const inputSumAbs = Circuit.if(inputSum.isPositive(), inputSum, inputSum.mul(Int64.minusOne));

console.log(`inputSum: ${inputSum.toString()}`);
console.log(`inputSumAbs: ${inputSumAbs.toString()}`);

const input3 = Int64.from(22);

const input1largest = input1.sub(input2).isPositive().and(input1.sub(input3).isPositive());
const input2largest = input2.sub(input1).isPositive().and(input2.sub(input3).isPositive());
const input3largest = input3.sub(input1).isPositive().and(input3.sub(input2).isPositive());

const largest = Circuit.switch([ input1largest, input2largest, input3largest ], Int64, [ input1, input2, input3 ])

console.log(`largest: ${largest.toString()}`);
```

With output:

```
inputSum: -5
inputSumAbs: 5
largest: 22
```

By inserting function calls, you can write circuits which usual if / else statements:

```ts
const result = Circuit.if(
  <condition>, 
  (() => { // TRUE
    <code to use if true>
    return <true-result>;
  })(),
  (() => { // FALSE
    <code to use if false>
    return <false-result>;
  })()
);
```

Note that unlike normal programming, because SnarkyJS under the hood is creating a zk cirucit, this is in fact executing both branches and selecting the one that matches the condition.

## Assertions

We've been using assertions throughout these tutorials already - but to clarify what they're doing, assertions are creating constraints in our circuit, that must hold true for a valid proof to be generated.

Besides the `assertEquals` we've often used, there is also `assertTrue` available on the Bool class.

## Merkle Trees

Lastly, let's go over an example using [merkle trees](../snarkyjs-reference/modules/Experimental#merkletree). Merkle trees are very powerful, since they let us manage large amounts of data within a circuit. In the [project corresponding to this tutorial](https://github.com/es92/zkApp-examples/tree/main/05-common-types-and-functions/src), you can find a full reference for the example here. The contract can be found in [BasicMerkleTreeContract.ts](https://github.com/es92/zkApp-examples/blob/main/05-common-types-and-functions/src/BasicMerkleTreeContract.ts), and the example can be found in a section of [main.ts](https://github.com/es92/zkApp-examples/blob/main/05-common-types-and-functions/src/main.ts).

Merkle trees are currently in the `Experimental` module of SnarkyJS. So start off by importing `Experimental`:
```ts
import {
  ...
  Experimental,
  ...
} from 'snarkyjs'
```

When using Merkle trees, you initialize an instance of the data structure on the "ui" side of your application at a particular height. 

In the smart contract though, you need to provide a "witness" for each update to the tree, which proves the connection between the existing tree in the smart contract, and the updated tree.

Here is a simple example of a contract that stores the root of a merkle tree, where each leaf stores a number, and the smart contract has an `update` function that adds a number to the leaf, while checking that the number added was less than 10:

```ts
...
  @state(Field) treeRoot = State<Field>();
...
  @method init(initialRoot: Field) {
    this.treeRoot.set(initialRoot);
  }

  @method update(
    leafWitness: MerkleWitness20, 
    numberBefore: Field,
    incrementAmount: Field,
  ) {
    const initialRoot = this.treeRoot.get();
    this.treeRoot.assertEquals(initialRoot);

    incrementAmount.assertLt(Field(10));

    // check the initial state matches what we expect
    const rootBefore = leafWitness.calculateRoot(numberBefore);
    rootBefore.assertEquals(initialRoot);

    // compute the root after incrementing
    const rootAfter = leafWitness.calculateRoot(numberBefore.add(incrementAmount));

    // set the new root
    this.treeRoot.set(rootAfter);
  }
```

And code to interact with it:

```ts
    // initialize the zkapp
    const zkapp = new BasicMerkleTreeContract(basicTreeZkAppAddress);

    // create a new tree
    const height = 20;
    const tree = new Experimental.MerkleTree(height);
    class MerkleWitness extends Experimental.MerkleWitness(height) {}

    // deploy the smart contract
    const deployTxn = await Mina.transaction(deployerAccount, () => {
      AccountUpdate.fundNewAccount(deployerAccount);
      zkapp.deploy({ zkappKey: basicTreeZkAppPrivateKey });
      // get the root of the new tree to use as the initial tree root
      zkapp.init(tree.getRoot());
      zkapp.sign(basicTreeZkAppPrivateKey);
    });
    await deployTxn.send().wait();

    const incrementIndex = 522;
    const incrementAmount = Field(9);

    // get the witness for the current tree
    const witness = new MerkleWitness(tree.getWitness(BigInt(incrementIndex)));

    // update the leaf locally
    tree.setLeaf(BigInt(incrementIndex), incrementAmount);

    // update the smart contract
    const txn1 = await Mina.transaction(deployerAccount, () => {
      zkapp.update(
        witness,
        Field.zero, // leafs in new trees start at a state of 0
        incrementAmount);
      zkapp.sign(basicTreeZkAppPrivateKey);
    });
    await txn1.send().wait();

    // compare the root of the smart contract tree to our local tree
    console.log(`BasicMerkleTree: local tree root hash after send1: ${tree.getRoot()}`);
    console.log(`BasicMerkleTree: smart contract root hash after send1: ${zkapp.treeRoot.get()}`);
```

While in this example leafs are fields, you can put more variables in a leaf by instead hashing an array of fields, and setting a leaf to that.

You can find this complete example in the [project directory](https://github.com/es92/zkApp-examples/tree/main/05-common-types-and-functions/src), as well as a more advanced example `LedgerContract`, which implements a basic ledger of tokens, including checks that the sender has signed their transaction and that the amount the sender has sent matches the amount the receiver receives.

## Conclusion

Congrats! We have finished reviewing more common types and functions in SnarkyJS. With this, should you now be capable of writing many advanced smart contracts and zkapps.
