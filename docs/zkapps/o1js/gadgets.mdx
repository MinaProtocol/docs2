# Gadgets

Gadgets are small, reusable low-level building blocks that simplify the process of creating new cryptographic primitives. Most gadgets build upon custom gates and act as low-level accelerators in the proof system.

In o1js, you can import these provable and helper methods from the `Gadgets` namespace:

- [Bitwise Operations](/zkapps/o1js/bitwise-operations)
- [Foreign Field Arithmetic](/zkapps/o1js/foreign-fields)

See the type declaration for [Gadgets](/zkapps/o1js-reference/modules#gadgets) in the o1js Reference documentation.
