# ECDSA and SHA3 in o1js

You can use the SHA3 and ECDSA primitives in o1js to interact with Ethereum.

:::experimental

Using ECDSA and SHA3 in o1js is experimental. To learn more, see [Experimental Features](/zkapps/experimental).

In o1js, you can do ?? with the ECDSA signature scheme and the SHA3 hash function family ??

ECDSA is the signature protocol used by Bitcoin, Ethereum and most blockchain
systems [27, 7], due to both Schnorr's copyright and ECDSA's relatively smaller key
size, especially when compared to RSA. Most RSA keys are 2,048 bits, but the much
shorter 256-bit ECDSA key provides roughly equal security to a 3,248 bit RSA key
[30].
ECDSA uses the [secp256k1](/glossary#secp256k1) curve.

Most existing blockchain and public key infrastructure uses this curve
for non-deterministic signatures 


## ECDSA

talk about ECDSA in a general way 
o1js does not use ECDSA natively because it is inefficient. 

from: https://www.notion.so/minaprotocol/ECDSA-ver-gadget-PoC-PRD-9458c38adf204d6b922deb8eed1ac193 
The ability to verify EVM-compatible ECDSA signatures in-circuit is an important primitive in enabling compatibility with Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains. 

## SHA3 and Keccak

talk about SHA3 in a general way

SHA3 algorithm is different than Keccak (talk about different parameters)


In o1js, you have access to multiple flavors of SHA3 combined under the shared namespace `Hash`. 

You can use these functions by calling `Hash.[hash_name].hash(xs)`. 


primitives = key building block that you can use to build your zkApp 
natively for signature verification we are using Schnorr (add to glossary and o1js FAQ)
natively for hashing we use Poseidon (add to glossary and o1js FAQ)

are widely used outside of Mina. For example, Ethereum uses ECDSA over secp256k1 for signatures - in order to "communicate" with the outside world and other blockchains, o1js (and, therefore Mina) needs to support these primitives as well. This RFC describes how we will leverage the custom gates implemented by the crypto team and expose them to o1js, making them accessible to smart contract developers.

You can leverage ECDSA and SHA3/Keccak to build applications that integrate with Ethereum and other use cases that require the use of said cryptographic primitives.
