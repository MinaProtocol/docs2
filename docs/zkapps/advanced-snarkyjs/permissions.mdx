:::info

Please note that zkApp programmability is not yet available on Mina Mainnet, but
zkApps can now be deployed to Berkeley Testnet.

Experimental. This API may change.

Specifically, we are looking into refactoring ZkProgram methods to explicitly return values rather than requiring them to be passed as further inputs.

# Permissions

Permissions are an integral part of zkApp development - they determine who has the authority to interact and make changes to a specific part of a smart contract.
Naturally, it's important for every smart contract to have a set of sound permissions to prevent any attacks or security holes.
Permissions live on-chain, that means they are a part of the account representation on the network, and are checked every time a transaction tries to interact with an account.

## Types of Permissions


Currently, there are 7 different types of permissions that guard a zkApp account and a developer can access and adjust.

`editState`: The Permission corresponding to the 8 state fields associated with an account.
Every smart contract account has 8 fields of on-chain state. This permissions describes how those 8 fields can be manipulated.

`send`: The Permission corresponding to the ability to send transactions from this account.


`receive`: Similar to `send`, the Permission corresponding to the ability to receive transactions to this account.
`setDelegate`: The Permission corresponding to the ability to set the delegate field of the account.
`setPermissions`: The Permission corresponding to the ability to change the permissions of the account.
`setVerificationKey`: The Permission corresponding to the ability to change the verification key of the account.
`setZkappUri`:  The Permission corresponding to the ability to change the zkapp uri field of the account.
`editSequenceState`: The Permission corresponding to the ability to change the sequence state of the associated account.
`setTokenSymbol`: The Permission corresponding to the ability to set the token symbol for this account.
`incrementNonce`: 
`setVotingFor`:
