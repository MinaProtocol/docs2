# Events

Events are _public_ arbitrary information that can be passed along with a transaction. Say, your zkApp allows users to publish a message -- those messages could be events!

Another use case for events are zkApps which keep some large internal state, and only store a commitment to that internal state on-chain. For example, a Merkle tree where only the root is stored in on-chain state. Events enable to attach the full information of state changes in transactions. In the Merkle tree example, this could mean sending any Merkle leaves that are changed by the transaction as events. This means that an observer of these transactions can follow along and keep track of the full Merkle tree on their side.

To use events, you have to declare an `events` field at the top level of your smart contract. It contains the _names_ and _types_ of your events. Here's an example:

```ts
class MyContract extends SmartContract {
  events = {
    'add-merkle-leaf': Field,
    'update-merkle-leaf': Field,
  };
}
```

In this example, we declare events called `"add-merkle-leaf"` and `"update-merkle-leaf"`, both with a type of `Field`. Instead of `Field`, you can also use other built-in SnarkyJS types as well as any `Struct`. (In fact, a custom `Struct` is probably better-suited to encode leaves of a Merkle tree -- we just use `Field` for simplicity here.)

After declaring your events, you can use `this.emitEvent(name, event)` in any smart contract method, where `event` has to have the type you declared for that `name`. Example:

```ts
class MyContract extends SmartContract {
  events = {
    "add-merkle-leaf": Field,
    "update-merkle-leaf": Field,
  }

  @method updateMerkleTree(leaf: Field, ...) {
    this.emitEvent("update-merkle-leaf", leaf);
    // ...
  }
}
```

Some other important facts about events:

- Events are not stored on-chain. Only events from the most recent couple of transactions are retained by consensus nodes. After that, they will be discarded, but are still accessible on archive nodes. In the near future, we plan to add an API to easily fetch events from an archive node.
- You can't refer to previously emitted events in a smart contract, because there is no way of proving that the events you refer to are actually the events emitted by that contract.

This is all you need to know about events! Think of them as a convenience feature -- a light-weight way of attaching information about your smart contract execution, which would otherwise get lost. Don't treat them as fully-fledged storage which can be safely accessed in smart contracts.

### Events: API reference

```ts
class SmartContract {
  static events?: Record<string, any>;

  emitEvent(name: string, event: any): void;
}
```

### Fetching Events from an Archive Node

Since Mina nodes do not store historical network information and events are not kept on-chain, emitted events are only preserved in the Archive Node. Consequently, a zkApp must fetch its previously emitted events on the Mina network from an Archive Node.

As the Archive Node is essentially a database, it does not offer a user-friendly API that SnarkyJS can readily utilize to fetch events. To address this issue, a GraphQL server was developed to retrieve network information such as events and actions from the Archive Node. SnarkyJS will use this GraphQL server to fetch events from the Archive Node.

To configure SnarkyJS to use an Archive Node to fetch events, use the `archive` property in the `Mina.Network` function. The `archive` property must be specified in the `Mina.Network` function to fetch events from an Archive Node; otherwise, an error will occur.

You can set the `archive` property to one of the following endpoints:

```sh
https://api.minascan.io/archive/berkeley/v1/graphql
```

```sh
https://archive.berkeley.minaexplorer.com
```

For example, to use the archive property, see the following example code:

```ts
const Network = Mina.Network({
  mina: '', // Use https://proxy.berkeley.minaexplorer.com/graphql or https://api.minascan.io/node/berkeley/v1/graphql
  archive: '', // Use https://api.minascan.io/archive/berkeley/v1/graphql/ or https://archive.berkeley.minaexplorer.com/
});
Mina.setActiveInstance(Network);
```

By setting the `archive` property to one of the listed endpoints, SnarkyJS uses the selected endpoint to fetch events. For instance, if a zkApp has already emitted events and broadcasted the transaction, you can use the `fetchEvents` function to retrieve events for a zkApp:

```ts
const zkapp = new MyContract(address);
// Fetch all events from zkapp starting at block 0
const events = await zkapp.fetchEvents(UInt32.from(0));

// Fetch all events starting at block 560 and ending at block 600
const events = await zkapp.fetchEvents(UInt32.from(560), UInt32.from(600));

// Fetch all events for a given address
const fetchedEvents = await fetchEvents({
  publicKey: 'B62qrfn5xxChtPGJne9HuDJZ4ziWVgWxeL3hntGBqMmf45p4hudo3tw',
});
```

`fetchEvents` accepts a starting block and an ending block.

If the ending block is not provided, it fetches all events up to the latest block.
If the starting block is not provided, it fetches all events from the beginning of the zkApp's history.

To see a end-to-end example of zkApp fetching events from a running network, [see this example](https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/blob/main/src/examples/zkapps/voting/run_berkeley.ts).

### Events vs Actions

Events and [Actions](actions-and-reducer) are two distinct mechanisms for logging information alongside a transaction.

- Events are not meant for use within proofs directly, as they can't be predicated on inside proofs. Events are used to signal to UIs, but can also be used for reconstructing Merkle trees.

- Actions can be accessed within provable code within a smart contract using a Reducer because a commitment to the relevant actions (for example, the action state) is stored on the zkApp account.

Events and Actions exist only in the transaction and on archive nodes. Events and actions are not stored directly in the Mina Ledger.
