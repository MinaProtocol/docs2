# Merkle Tree

#### Referencing off-chain data

We already learned that zkApps can only store a small amount of data on-chain, the reason for that is we want Mina to stay succinct and not become bloated.
But some zkApps might require you to access more than what you can store on-chain in a zkApp account.
But how can we achieve that? The answer is a Merkle tree! Merkle trees (or similar structures such as Verkle trees) allow us to _reference_ off-chain data by
only storing one single hash on-chain!

#### How does that work?

Merkle trees are special binary trees in which every leaf (the nodes at the very bottom of the tree!) are cryptographic hashes of the underlying pieces of data and the internal nodes are labelled with the cryptographic hash of the concatenated labels (hashes) of its child nodes.

By following this algorithm to the very top, we end up with one single node (the root node) that stores the root hash of the tree. The root hash is a reference to all pieces of data that were included in the tree's leaves. By doing so, we achieve that we can reference large amounts of data by only using one small hash! Another thing that Merkle trees provide is something called the witness (sometimes also called Merkle proof or Merkle path) - the witness is the path from one specific leaf node to the very top of the tree - to the root! Merkle witnesses are proofs of inclusion exists, they allow us to prove that one specific piece of data(an account in the ledger or the scores on a leaderboard) exists within the entire tree.

#### How will that be useful for zkApps?

We just learned that we can reference large amounts of off-chain data and prove inclusion of very specific parts of that data only with a small hash - the root - and something called a witness.

When we want to use Merkle trees and reference off-chain data in our zkApps on Mina, we can simply store the root of the tree on-chain and voil√†,
we now have access to more data off-chain!

Let's imagine a zkApp that manages a game with a leaderboard. The zkApp has a method to update the score of a player, if the player guesses a number correctly.
Once a player reaches a threshold score, they can invoke another method to get a reward. Because we want many players to participate in our game,
we are drastically limited by how much data we can store on-chain - and if we want to have at least 8 or more participants, we will run out of on-chain space very fast!

A possible solution to that problem would be to utilize the power of Merkle trees and store the public keys of each player and their corresponding scores off-chain and only reference it in our smart contract.

Lets look at our data structure first. Imagine wanting to map a player's id to score points, so this:

```

0: 5 points
1: 3 points
2: 0 points
3: 8 points
... : ...
7: 2 points

```

#### Implementing the smart contract

Now it's time to look at what our leaderboard zkApp might look like. We want to have on-chain state that points to the off-chain Merkle tree - we will call this variable the `root`.

:::info

Sometimes the variable `root` is also called commitment, because we commit to something!

:::

Additionally, we want to store a variable `z` which is the hash of the value a player has to guess: `H(guess) = z`

:::info

Guessing a simple hash like in this example can easily be brute forced, especially if the preimage is something simple (like a 5 letter word or a small number with only a few digits).

Please make sure that your zkApps are always secure, especially when dealing with funds!

:::

The first method allows a player to make a guess, and if the guess is correct, the player will gain one point.
The method takes the players guess and hashes it, it then checks if the hash H(guess) equals the on-chain state z and if that's the case,
then the player gains one point on the score board.

We will also need a second method that takes care of the reward. It checks if the players score is over a threshold and pays out a reward if that's the case.
This method will also have to verify our Merkle witness and check it if it matches the on-chain stored Merkle root!

:::note

A fully working example, including all the necessary boilerplate code, can be found in the SnarkyJS repository in the examples folder [here](https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/tree/main/src/examples/zkapps/merkle_tree).

:::

```ts
class Leaderboard extends SmartContract {
  // the root is the root hash of our off-chain Merkle tree
  @state(Field) root = State<Field>();

  // z is the hashed number we want to guess!
  @state(Field) z = State<Field>();

  init() {
    super.init();

    // this is our hash we want to guess! its the hash of the preimage "22", but keep it a secret!
    this.z.set(
      Field(
        '17057234437185175411792943285768571642343179330449434169483610110583519635705'
      )
    );
  }

  @method guessPreimage(guess: Field, account: Account, path: MerkleWitness) {
    // we fetch z from the chain
    const z = this.z.get();
    this.z.assertEquals(z);

    // if our guess preimage hashes to our target, we won a point!
    Poseidon.hash([guess]).assertEquals(z);

    // we fetch the on-chain commitment/root
    const root = this.root.get();
    this.root.assertEquals(root);

    // we check that the account is within the committed Merkle Tree
    path.calculateRoot(account.hash()).assertEquals(root);

    // we update the account and grant one point!
    let newAccount = account.addPoints(1);

    // we calculate the new Merkle Root, based on the account changes
    const newRoot = path.calculateRoot(newAccount.hash());

    this.root.set(newRoot);
  }

  @method claimReward(account: Account, path: MerkleWitness) {
    // we fetch the on-chain commitment
    const root = this.root.get();
    this.root.assertEquals(root);

    // we check that the account is within the committed Merkle Tree
    path.calculateRoot(account.hash()).assertEquals(root);

    // we check that the account has at least 10 score points in order to claim the reward
    account.score.assertGte(UInt32.from(10));

    // finally, we send the player a reward
    this.send({
      to: account.address,
      amount: 100_000_000,
    });
  }
}
```

Merkle trees allow us to easily reference off-chain data by only adding a couple of lines of code.
However, it is important to mention that the developer of the zkApp must make sure that the Merkle tree that is being referenced on-chain is always in-sync with the actual off-chain data structure.

You can look at [this example in the SnarkyJS repository](https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/tree/main/src/examples/zkapps/merkle_tree) to get a better understanding of how you can utilize the power of Merkle trees.

:::info

Merkle trees are great for _referencing_ off-chain state. But just referencing our state is not enough - we also need to actually store it somewhere.

Where and how to store the data off-chain storage is left up to the developer. We will document a recommended method in time, but are currently exploring solutions and would be very interested to see and hear about approaches from others in the community.

### Merkle Tree - API reference

```ts
const treeHeight = 8;

// creates a tree of height 8
const Tree = new MerkleTree(treeHeight);

// creates the corresponding MerkleWitness class that is circuit-compatible
class MyMerkleWitness extends MerkleWitness(treeHeight) {}

// sets a value at position 0n
Tree.setLeaf(0n, Field(123));

// gets the current root of the tree
const root = Tree.getRoot();

// gets a plain witness for leaf at index 0n
const witness = Tree.getWitness(0n);

// creates a circuit-compatible witness
const circuitWitness = new MyMerkleWitness(witness);

// calculates the root of the witness
const calculatedRoot = circuitWitness.calculateRoot(Field(123));

calculatedRoot.assertEquals(root);
```
