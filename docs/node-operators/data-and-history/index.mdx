# Data and History



### Recent Data

Presented [here](./querying-data.mdx) are examples about querying for _recent_ information on the chain -- in practice exposed is ~10 hours of recent activity in the remaining testnets and the first version of Mainnet. 

The best way to explore all the specific details available for each of the GraphQL objects is to visit your favorite web browser pointing to the REST server running from within a Mina daemon that hosts a GraphQL sandbox. Visit the [GraphQL API page](/node-developers/graphql-api) to learn more. Documentation is also present on most of the individual fields, you can learn more about each field by hovering over the entries in the sandbox or by visiting the hosted schema (coming soon).


### Historic Data

As Mina is a succinct blockchain, historical information can be accessed using [an archival process](/node-operators/archive-nodes/getting-started).
