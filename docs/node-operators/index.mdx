# Introduction

The [Mina Protocol](/mina-protocol) is a layer 1 blockchain which is secured by [proof of stake consensus](/mina-protocol/proof-of-stake).

Currently there are three public Mina networks:

1. Mainnet - the production network
2. Devnet - the test network based on the same software versions as the mainnet
3. Berkley Test Network - a development network where new features are trialed

## Node Operators

Node operators are network participants who run mina nodes on a Mina network.

In this section we describe operations on Mina and how the Node Operators can run Mina nodes.

## Mina Nodes

A node is a machine running the Mina daemon. Different nodes fulfill different roles within the Mina network:

1. Block Producer - this is analogous to being a Bitcoin "miner" or a "validator" in other proof-of-stake networks. By staking MINA, you can be selected to produce a block and win the block reward.

2. SNARK Coordinators - distribute work to a series of SNARK workers in parallel to block production.

3. Snark Workers -  Snark workers create [zk-snarks](https://minaprotocol.com/blog/what-are-zk-snarks) for each transaction. These `zk-snarks` are used to create recursive `zk-snarks` proving the correctness of a block and in turn these `zk-snarks` are used to create a recursive `zk-snark` which proves the the correctness of the network. These `zk-snark` help provide the Mina Protocol with succinctness. 

4. Archive Nodes - A Mina node configued to store historical chain data to a persistent data source, currently PostgreSQL

5. Seed Nodes - Keep a record of nodes in the network and enable nodes joining the network to connect to peer nodes


## Mina Protocol

[Mina Protocol](../mina-protocol) describes how the Mina Protocol works.

## Node Developers

[Node Developers](../node-developers) are developers who add to and improve Mina nodes.

## Exchange Operators

[Exchange Operators](../exchange-operators/faq) connect to Mina networks to provide access to the MINA token.
