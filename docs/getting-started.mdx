# Getting Started

Welcome to Mina! This section walks you through the process of setting up a Mina node, provides instructions on how to generate a keypair for use with the network, connect to the network, and begin producing blocks.

## Requirements

**Software**: Supported environments include macOS, Linux (Debian 9 and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS), and any host with Docker.

Note: Windows is not officially supported. However, community members have successfully set up nodes using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). 

- See [Mina on Windows](https://minawiki.com/index.php?title=Mina_on_Windows) for community-created instructions. 
- See the [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) documentation to use Windows containers that run directly on the Windows host with Administrator privileges.

**Hardware**: Special hardware is not required. To run a block producer on the Mina network, requires a mininum hardware configuration of:

- At least an 8-core processor
- At least 16 GB of RAM

More RAM might be required to run a SNARK worker node at the same time as a block producer. GPUs may be required for node operators after the protoctol is upgraded.

**Network**: At least 1 Mbps connection

**VM Instances**:

O(1) Labs has tested running nodes on several cloud providers. We recommend the following instances for basic node operator needs. Custom requirements and different cost constraints might require a different instance type.

- AWS [c5.2xlarge](https://www.ec2instances.info/?filter=c5.2xl&region=us-west-2&cost_duration=daily&selected=c5.2xlarge)
- GCP [c2-standard-8](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/compute-optimized-machines)
- Azure [Standard_F8s_v2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/fsv2-series)
- Digital Ocean [c-8-16gib](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new?size=c-8-16gib)

## Installation

The newest binary releases can be found below. Instructions are provided for macOS and Linux below:

This is a large download, around 1GB, so the install might take some time.

### Ubuntu 18.04 / Debian 9

Add the Mina Debian repo and install:

```
echo "deb [trusted=yes] http://packages.o1test.net release main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mina.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y curl unzip mina-mainnet=1.1.5-a42bdee
```

Check that daemon installed correctly by running `mina version`. The output should read `Commit a42bdeef6b0c15ee34616e4df76c882b0c5c7c2a on branch master`.

### Windows

Windows is not natively supported. 

Instead, use the Docker instructions.

### macOS

macOS is used by developers.

Instead, use the Docker instructions or build from source.

### Docker

Docker is a cross-platform tool. You can download and install Docker on multiple platforms. Use the Docker installation instructions for your platform on [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). After docker is installed, go to the Mina Docker instructions on [Connecting to the Network](../node-developers/connecting-to-the-network.mdx).

### Build from source

On Linux distribution or macOS, you can experiment with [Building Mina](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/blob/master/README-dev.md#building-mina) from source code. Other operating systems haven't been tested thoroughly and might have issues. You can share logs and get troubleshooting help in the [Mina Protocol Discord server](https://discord.gg/minaprotocol).

## Set up port forwarding and firewalls

If you are running a firewall, you must allow traffic on TCP port 8302. 

Unless the `-external-ip YOUR_IP` flag is provided, the daemon uses HTTPS (443) and HTTP (80) to determine its own IP address.

You might need to configure your router's port forwarding to allow inbound traffic to the following ports through your **external** IP address.

- `TCP` port `8302`
- _Optional_ To use the GraphQL service, expose `TCP` port `3085`

## Next

Now that you've installed Mina and configured your network, you can generate a keypair.
