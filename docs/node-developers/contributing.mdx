# Contributing to Mina

Mina is an open-source project with a mission to build an inclusive and sustainable community-driven protocol. As such, Mina welcomes contributions from anyone with a desire to further this goal.

Currently, the protocol is in development and benefits from contributions in the form of writing code, user testing, documentation, and community support. For specific instructions for contributing in each of these domains, see the codebase repositories or ask in [Mina Protocol Discord](https://discord.gg/minaprotocol).

For general questions on how to get involved, reach out to the Mina community on the [Mina Protocol Discord](https://discord.gg/minaprotocol) server.

## Developers

Mina is entirely open source, and the code is distributed under the terms of the [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/blob/master/LICENSE).
