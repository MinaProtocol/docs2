# Contributing to Mina

Mina is an open-source project with a mission to build an inclusive and sustainable community-driven protocol. As such, Mina welcomes contributions from anyone with a desire to further this goal.

Currently, the protocol is in development and would benefit from contributions in the form of writing code, user testing, documentation, and community support. Below, you will find specific instructions for contributing in each of these domains.

For any general questions on how to get involved, feel free to reach out to the Mina community on the [Discord server](https://bit.ly/MinaDiscord).

## Developers

Mina is entirely open source, and the code is distributed under the terms of the [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Mina Grants

O(1) Labs provides grants for certain projects related to the development of Mina -- visit the [Mina Grants page](https://minaprotocol.com/grants) to find out more details.

Currently, the projects are mostly programming focused, but more will be added in the areas of design and community development. Reach out on Discord if you have any questions about the grant program.

## Reporting Issues

If you notice any [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) violations, please follow the Reporting Guidelines in that document to file a report and alert the community to any bad behavior.

If you encounter any critical bugs or vulnerabilities in the protocol, please report them to security@minaprotocol.com. For minor bugs and issues, please create an issue on Github.
