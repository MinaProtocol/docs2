# Introduction

Exchange operators are network participants who run mina nodes on a Mina network, but usually don't produce blocks.

Instead of running Mina Node and Mina Archive, we recommend to run Rosetta API, designed specifically for exchange operators needs.

It implements an [open-source blockchain-agnostic specification](https://docs.cloud.coinbase.com/rosetta/docs/welcome) designed by Coinbase.

## Rosetta API

This section describes how to install, run and use the Rosetta API instance connected to the Mina network
