        Other blockchain protocols are so heavy they require intermediaries to
        run nodes, recreating the same old power dynamics. But Mina is light, so
        anyone can connect peer-to-peer and quickly sync and verify the chain.
        Built on a consistent-sized cryptographic proof, the blockchain will
        stay accessible—even as it scales.

        With Mina, anyone who's syncing the chain is also validating
        transactions like a full node. Mina's design means any participant can
        take part in proof-of-stake consensus, have access to strong
        censorship-resistance and secure the blockchain.

        Other blockchain protocols don’t interact with the internet, limiting
        their applications’ scope and utility. But Mina’s zkApp can privately
        interact with any website and access verified real world data for use
        on-chain. So developers can leverage the world’s information in
        computing and decision-making to change the way we live and work —
        without ever compromising the privacy of users' sensitive data.
